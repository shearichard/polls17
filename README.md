'Polls' for Heroku
------------------
To illustrate what's required to deploy a simple Django project to Heroku I've takent the 'official' Tutorial app and made the necessary changes to make it work for Heroku

Running the project locally
-----------------------------
My virtenv is called `polls17`, you've probably called yours something else. If you don't have a virtenv I suggest you do so.

```
python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
```
